# 🐚 ShellOut

Welcome to ShellOut, a simple package that enables you to easily “shell out” from a Swift script or command line tool.

Even though you can accomplish most of the tasks you need to do in native Swift code, sometimes you need to invoke the power of the command line from a script or tool - and this is exactly what ShellOut makes so simple.

## Usage

Just call `shellOut()`, and specify what command you want to run, along with any arguments you want to pass:

```swift
let output = try shellOut(to: "echo", arguments: ["Hello world"])
print(output) // Hello world
```

You can also easily run a series of commands at once, optionally at a given path:

```swift
try shellOut(to: ["mkdir NewFolder", "echo \"Hello again\" > NewFolder/File"], at: "~/CurrentFolder")
let output = try shellOut(to: "cat File", at: "~/CurrentFolder/NewFolder")
print(output) // Hello again
```

In case of an error, ShellOut will automatically read `STDERR` and format it nicely into a typed Swift error:

```swift
do {
    try shellOut(to: "totally-invalid")
} catch {
    let error = error as! ShellOutError
    print(error.message) // Prints STDERR
    print(error.output) // Prints STDOUT
}
```

## Pre-defined commands

Another way to use ShellOut is by executing pre-defined commands, that enable you to easily perform common tasks without having to construct commands using strings. It also ships with a set of such pre-defined commands for common tasks, such as using Git, manipulating the file system and using tools like [Marathon](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Marathon), [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) and [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools).

### Use Git

```swift
try shellOut(to: .gitInit())
try shellOut(to: .gitClone(url: repositoryURL))
try shellOut(to: .gitCommit(message: "A scripted commit!"))
try shellOut(to: .gitPush())
try shellOut(to: .gitPull(remote: "origin", branch: "release"))
try shellOut(to: .gitSubmoduleUpdate())
try shellOut(to: .gitCheckout(branch: "my-feature"))
```

### Handle files, folders and symlinks

```swift
try shellOut(to: .createFolder(named: "folder"))
try shellOut(to: .createFile(named: "file", contents: "Hello world"))
try shellOut(to: .moveFile(from: "path/a", to: "path/b"))
try shellOut(to: .copyFile(from: "path/a", to: "path/b"))
try shellOut(to: .openFile(at: "Project.xcodeproj"))
try shellOut(to: .readFile(at: "Podfile"))
try shellOut(to: .removeFile(from: "path/a"))
try shellOut(to: .createSymlink(to: "target", at: "link"))
try shellOut(to: .expandSymlink(at: "link"))
```

### Use [Marathon](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Marathon)

```swift
try shellOut(to: .runMarathonScript(at: "~/scripts/MyScript", arguments: ["One", "Two"]))
try shellOut(to: .updateMarathonPackages())
```

### Use [The Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)

```swift
try shellOut(to: .createSwiftPackage(withType: .executable))
try shellOut(to: .updateSwiftPackages())
try shellOut(to: .generateSwiftPackageXcodeProject())
try shellOut(to: .buildSwiftPackage())
try shellOut(to: .testSwiftPackage())
try shellOut(to: .cleanSwiftArtifacts())
```

### Use [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools)

```swift
try shellOut(to: .runFastlane(usingLane: "appstore"))
```

### Use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

```swift
try shellOut(to: .updateCocoaPods())
try shellOut(to: .installCocoaPods())
```

Don't see what you're looking for in the list above? You can easily define your own commands using `ShellOutCommand`. If you've made a command you think should be included among the built-in ones, feel free to [open a PR](https://github.com/JohnSundell/ShellOut/pull/new/master)!

## Installation

### For scripts

- Install [Marathon](https://github.com/johnsundell/marathon).
- Add ShellOut to Marathon using `$ marathon add https://github.com/JohnSundell/ShellOut.git`.
- Alternatively, add `https://github.com/JohnSundell/ShellOut.git` to your `Marathonfile`.
- Write your script, then run it using `$ marathon run yourScript.swift`.

### For command line tools

- Add `.package(url: "https://github.com/JohnSundell/ShellOut.git", from: "2.0.0")` to your `Package.swift` file's `dependencies`.
- Update your packages using `$ swift package update`.
